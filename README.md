# 2018 Missoula Marathon Results
Tags: *python, analytics, data viz*

## Project Overview
This is a personal project. I recently wrapped up the Data Analytics Nanodegree from Udcacity and wanted a way to solidify and build on what I've learned. The goal here is to work through the process of data analysis from start to finish. I figured I'd go local and explore the results of my city's marathon and half-marathon for 2018. 

**Steps:**
- Gather data. In this case, scrape the data ([results_scrapper.py])(https://github.com/4one4/2018-Missoula-Marathon/blob/master/results_scrapper.py) from the results website and store it locally as a .csv file.
- Assess the data. Look through the resulting files for potential insights or issues.
- Clean the data. Clean up any problems in the data (missing fields, bad data types, etc...)
- Create features. If necessary, create new fields to aide in analysis.
- Present findings. I want to create a somewhat technical summary of my findings as well as a visualization (Tableau public?).
